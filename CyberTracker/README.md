# GIS Cybertracker

I found this application thanks to Dr. Todd Bacastow, in his course of GeoIntelligence.

This is the reference to the Cybertracker site. It is not only software, it contains a lot of _"Humanware"_

CyberTracker has grown from a simple hypothesis: The art of tracking may have been the origin of science. Science may have evolved more than a hundred thousand years ago with the evolution of modern hunter-gatherers. Scientific reasoning may therefore be an innate ability of the human mind. This may have far-reaching implications for indigenous knowledge, self-education and citizen science.

*I used this software to track in the canton of Geneva fishing activity.*

To use it, you need to download the "Software" from the Cybertracker site and then you can add this application.

You can create your own applications and record your own tracks and enjoy the outdoors.
